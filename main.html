	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how long an algorithm takes to complete, relative to the size of the input. It’s usually expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm’s execution time.Choosing the right algorithm with suitable time complexity is crucial for efficient program execution.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs, in terms of the size of the input. It represents the maximum amount of memory an algorithm uses, excluding the input itself.An algorithm that uses memory proportional to the input size (N) has a space complexity of O(N). For example, a function that sorts an array of integers using a simple swap-based algorithm uses memory linearly proportional to the size of the array.</p>
